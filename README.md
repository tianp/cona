# components
Reusable libraries wrapper

This module is a wrapper of some nodejs libraries that I mostly using across projects. I won't publish this as as public module, at least any time soon.

## How to install

Add ```"components": "https://github.com/tianpermana/components/archive/v0.1.0.tar.gz"``` in your ```package.json``` dependencies

Then run:

```npm install```
